## Overview

This project aims to design an **AI-powered system** that predicts emotional states—such as **happiness**, **sadness**, and **fear**—from **EEG brainwave signals**.  
By analyzing neural activity patterns and applying advanced **machine learning algorithms**, the system can accurately classify emotions in real time.

The goal is to assist **healthcare professionals** in understanding patients’ emotional conditions, especially those unable to communicate, thus enhancing **emotional awareness** and **patient-centered care**.

## Features

- Real-time EEG signal processing and classification  
- Machine learning model based on XGBoost  
- Data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization pipeline  
- Flask-based web interface for live emotion prediction  
- Modular, reproducible structure based on Cookiecutter Data Science
