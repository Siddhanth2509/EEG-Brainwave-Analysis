# predicting human emotions using AI from brainwaves documentation!

## Description

This project aims to design an intelligent system that predicts emotional states—such as happiness, sadness, and fear—from patients’ brainwave (EEG) signals. By analyzing neural patterns and applying machine learning algorithms, the system can accurately classify these emotions in real time. The objective is to assist healthcare professionals in understanding patients’ emotional conditions, especially for those who cannot easily communicate their feelings, thereby improving emotional awareness and patient-centered care
